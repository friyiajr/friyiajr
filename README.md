## Hi there 👋 

I'm Dan! A software engineer based out of Toronto who is passionate about React, React-Native, Native iOS, Native Android and pretty much anything front end and mobile 😄. 

This is my professional portfolio as well as where I keep code from my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4Lepw3SuzwYWcHQ6SDPlEQ">YouTube Videos</a>.

## On the side, I love working with Hardware Technologies ❤️
