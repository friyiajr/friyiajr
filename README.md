## Hi there 👋 

I'm Dan! A software engineer based out of Toronto who is passionate about React, React-Native, Native iOS, Native Android and pretty much anything front end and mobile 😄. I keep all my code examples from my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@DanRNLab) here ❤️

I enjoy pushing front end tools to deliver truely unique and interactive user experiances. Check out my projects below for some examples 🙂.

## My favorite project is this one using Computer Vision and Expo (React-Native) 👨‍🔬 [LINK](https://github.com/friyiajr/AiSwingPlaneTrackerStarter)
